<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently studying for a Ph. D. degree in University Of Science And Technology Of China (USTC). My supervisor is Prof. Zheng-Jun Zha. 
I am also a Junior Researcher at Computer Vision and Multimedia Lab of JD AI Research working with Dr. Wu Liu and Dr. Tao Mei.

My research interests include multimedia computing, computer vision, and their applications in retail. I have published 8 papers at the international conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FZJ-fFYAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>60+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FZJ-fFYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>) and [github stars 3682](https://github.com/SheldongChen).
